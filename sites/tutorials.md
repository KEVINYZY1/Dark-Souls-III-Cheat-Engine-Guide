#### Weapon upgrades and infusions represented through ID

Quote from Zanzer:
>Here's a brief explanation about how weapon upgrades and infusions are represented in memory.
I will be using decimal notation (not hex) because you will need to use math.
Each weapon has a base Item ID value. For example, the Club has the ID 8000000 (decimal).
For upgrades, you simply add +1 through +99. So, 8000007 would be a Club +7.
Now infusions are a multiple of 100. So for every +100 you'll cycle through each infusion.
For example, 8000500 would be a Crystal Club. While 8000507 would be a Crystal Club +7.

>Add the following values to the base Item ID for the specific infusion:  
+100 Heavy  
+200 Sharp  
+300 Refined  
+400 Simple  
+500 Crystal  
+600 Fire  
+700 Chaos  
+800 Lightning  
+900 Deep  
+1000 Dark  
+1100 Poison  
+1200 Blood   
+1300 Raw  
+1400 Blessed  
+1500 Hollow
